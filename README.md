# DAC15203: 4D Design

## Virtual pet (Egg)

**Name:** Michail Dzigajev

**Student No:** 96410016

**Course:** BA (Hons) Design & Coding, Level 2.

**Unit Code:** DAC15203

### **Introduction**
Welcome the pet README file. This is an instruction manual on how to start up the pet demo, due to the main scrip currenty not being fully functional, and instead I'm showing the visual features of the pet within the demo version that cycles through the sleep mode times and allows you to press the button to reset itself to the smile animation state.

### **Instructions**

##### **Here is how to start up the pet Demo mode**
1. Unfortuanly you will have to take off both the top shells of the pet by lightly puuling them away from the base. This is due to me having under-volting issues with the Lithuim battery that is in place at the entry of the 3D base hole, so the Pi is no longer powered by the battery temporarily.  I had to remove the wires that connect the battery and Pi while the issue is being resolved, in addition to there being issues of extening the standard power cable to the Pi for which I made an attempt but could do it safely.

2. Once the shells are off, please plug in the power cable provided with the pet. Make sure to not unplug any of the wires connecting to the shell NeoPixels or button.
3. Place the top shell of the pet over the neoPixel shell and leave it there. 
4. Proceed to powering up the pet by clicking the switch button on the wire.
5. Give the pet a minute or two to boot-up. Once the pet is working the Demo sequence will activate using supervisor.
6. You can then interact with the pet by click on the silver tactile button at the top. Don't be afraid to bush it, as the button is hidden underneath a layer of rubber. 
7. When the button is pressed the pet will revert to the Smile animation state and repeat the process. 
8. Once you are done, simply click on the cable switch again to turn it off.
9. Place the shell in to the grooves one after the other, and firly secure by pushing down on the shell to slot in with friction.
10. Please refer to the video guide in submitted files if steps above are not clear.

### **Overview**

The pet is running the Demo version due to failure to complete the main script successfully. All individual parts work pet work as shown in one of the videos submitted (Counter, Sound, Button & LEDs). Also the pet currently does not fully support communication with the web interface server, as I could not accomplish an effective method of transferring data to Mlab where it was stored. 

The interface is oerational, and displays the counter mechanism I would use to determin the pets happinenss in a form of a percentage gauge, which is split in to the 4 mode categories the pet displays.
